= Neo4j-OGM Integration

The current Spring Boot starter you get on https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.2.6.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=1.8&groupId=com.example&artifactId=demo&name=demo&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.demo&dependencies=data-neo4j[start.spring.io] recognizes the driver bean created by this starter here.
That means you can add this starter via `{groupId}:{artifactId}:{neo4j-java-driver-spring-boot-starter_version}` and use the properties under `{config_prefix}` to configure the connection.
Thus you don't have to work your way into Neo4j-OGM to manipulate the encapsulated driver but inject a correctly configured driver bean into the Neo4j-OGM session factory.
