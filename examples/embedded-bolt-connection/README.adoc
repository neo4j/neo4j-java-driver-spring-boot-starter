= Using an embedded database with the Driver starter

This example demonstrates a couple things:

1. How to provide an instance of the Neo4j `DatabaseManagementService` as a managed bean into a Spring context.
1. How to keep the configuration for the driver and the embedded instance in sync.
1. This starter can connect against an embedded instance with the Bolt connector enabled.

While the <<testing-with-neo4j-harness,test harness example>> focuses on having an embedded instance through the harness in
your context, this example focuses on having the embedded API for whatever reasons in your context.

One of those reasons might be that you want to be able to use the `GraphDatabaseService`
to execute Cypher without Bolt involved or traverse nodes manually.
Here is one made up example that uses the `GraphDatabaseService` to find all nodes with a label `Movie`:

[[GraphDatabaseService-usecase]]
[source,java,indent=0]
.Accessing the `GraphDatabaseService` from a service
----
try(var tx = databaseManagementService.database("neo4j").beginTx()) {
    return tx.findNodes(Label.label("Movie"))
        .stream()
        .map(n -> n.getProperty("title"))
        .map(String.class::cast)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
----

The `MovieService` in the sources of this example however is exactly the same as the one in the other examples.
It is not aware against what kind of server it is connected and just gets a Driver `Session` with `var session = driver.session()`.

== Provide a managed, embedded `DatabaseManagementService` and keep it in sync with the driver.

First, provide the necessary dependencies:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependencies>
    <!-- Embbedded instance -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>neo4j</artifactId>
        <version>{neo4j_version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Necessary bolt server -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>neo4j-bolt</artifactId>
        <version>{neo4j_version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

Depending on your setup, you might have to exclude the following artifact from both dependencies above: `org.slf4j:slf4j-nop`,
as it clashes with Spring Boots default logger.

The enterprise edition lives under different coordinates
(`com.neo4j:neo4j-enterprise`, which are not available in Maven central but only to customers).

Configuration is done with the following components:

[[EmbeddedConfig-Properties]]
[source,java,indent=0]
.DatabaseManagementServiceProperties.java
----
include::src/main/java/org/neo4j/doc/driver/springframework/boot/embedded/DatabaseManagementServiceProperties.java[tags=EmbeddedConfig-Properties]
----
<.> Make this class a component containing configurational properties under the prefix `org.neo4j.database-management-service`.
    This prefix is the canonical form. Camel- and Snakecases (`databaseManagementService` respectivly `DATABASE_MANAGEMENT_SERVICE`
    work as well.
    These properties can come from `application.properties` or `application.yml` as well as from the environment and of course,
    config servers.
<.> This configuration is needed for the embedded instance. The embedded instance needs to store its data somewhere.

With a properties class like this, you can have all the relevant configuration properties in one place, instead of
manually juggling with `@Value` and related.


[[EmbeddedConfig]]
[source,java,indent=0]
.Configuring the embedded instance with the driver in mind
----
include::src/main/java/org/neo4j/doc/driver/springframework/boot/embedded/Neo4jConfig.java[tags=EmbeddedConfig]
----
<.> Mark this class as a configurational bean.
    We can make the startup of the Spring context a bit fast, as we don't need to proxy the methods.
<.> Define the class that represents the configuration properties.
<.> This marks the returned value as Spring bean for the context
<.> We only fire up the embedded instance in some conditions.
    This is optional, but makes perfect sense in a setup where both the embedded instance and the driver should be available.
<.> We check if someone had configured the home directory for the instance.
    If so, we use that, otherwise we default to something random.
<.> Here, we use the same port that has been given to the driver for the port the embedded bolt listens to.
    Choose any other port you want (or a random free one), but keep in mind,
    that you have to reconfigure the driver as well then (through `org.neo4j.driver.uri`).
<.> This is a `Condition` to be used with `@Conditional`.
    It makes sure in 4. that we bring up an embedded instance only when the driver actually targets something on localhost via the bolt protocol.
    This later step is completely optional, but keeps you from funny surprise.

== Using the driver against the embedded instance

To the outside world, nothing indicates that the service runs against embedded:

[[MovieService]]
[source,java,indent=0]
.Accessing the `GraphDatabaseService` from a service
----
include::src/main/java/org/neo4j/doc/driver/springframework/boot/embedded/MoviesService.java[tags=usage]
----

You can of course inject the `DatabaseManagementService` or - if you provide those as beans as well - dedicated
`GraphDatabaseService`-instances for the databases you want to work with.

Let's walk through a test setup.
The tests prepares the data directly against the embedded instance and than tests the service:

[source,java,indent=0]
.MoviesServiceTest.java
----
include::src/test/java/org/neo4j/doc/driver/springframework/boot/embedded/MoviesServiceTest.java[tags=test]
----
<.> Make it a standard, full blown `@SpringBootTest`, applying the same configuration found from walking the packages
    starting at the `@SpringBootApplication`.
<.> This brings in dynamic test properties in the `registry`.
    It is available since Spring Boot 2.2.6.
<.> We use `SocketUtils` to find a random free port.
    We give that random free port to the driver URI which is in turn used by <<EmbeddedConfig, the embedded config>> to configure the published Bolt port.
    This is necessary to not clash with any running databases on the test machine.
<.> Uncommenting the next line gives you the opportunity to point the embedded instance to a directory containing pre-seeded
    data during test for example.
<.> Springs JUnit 5 integration allows beans to be injected in all phases of a JUnit 5 test.
    Here we use the `@BeforeAll` phase to access the embedded database to create test data.
<.> We want to test the service shown in <<MovieService,MovieService.java>>, which works with the driver.
