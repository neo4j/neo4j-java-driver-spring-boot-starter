= Reactive Web

This example uses the `neo4j://` protocol, which by defaults uses routing.
Apart from that, the configuration is the same as with the simple example.

The driver is however used as a source for a reactive Neo4j session, which in turn produces results for a reactive Spring Rest Controller:

[source,java]
[[reactive-we-example]]
.DisplayMoviesController.java
