== Introduction

This brings additional support for the Neo4j 4.0 Test Harness to the Driver starter:

* It brings in the correct dependencies
* It provides auto configuration for the Test Harness:
** If there's a `Neo4j` bean instance, it configures a corresponding `Driver` bean that uses it
** If the test harness is available and there's no `Neo4j` bean, it creates one and opens a `Driver` instance to it.
